Transactional Memory and Memory Allocators Interaction Study
===============

The initial version of this repository contains the source code and scripts
used to generate the data used in our PPoPP'15 paper, entitled `Performance 
Implications of Dynamic Memory Allocators on Transactional Memory Systems`.

I still need to do a lot of things here, such as:

* Describe the third-party source code (STM libraries, allocators, ...)
  * Directory structure
* Describe dependencies (compiler, R, ...)
* Describe how to use the automation scripts
  * Environment variables setup

For now this project is just a copy of the artifact we have created for the AE.
I hope to have everything set up before the conference (early February). For
now you are pretty much on your own. Take a look at the artifact home page for
details: http://lampiao.lsc.ic.unicamp.br/~baldas/artifact/ppopp15-artifact.html.
